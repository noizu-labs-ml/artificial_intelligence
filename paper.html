<p dir="auto">Abstract</p>
<p dir="auto">The present study investigates the integration of dynamic bias injection layers into Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI) systems, aiming to enhance adaptability and responsiveness.
Grounded in the limitations of existing AGI configurations, the research explores an innovative
approach leveraging fine-tuning mechanisms akin to human cognitive processes. Utilizing the
transformer architecture as a base, we extend the traditional input and weight framework to
include additional nodes designed to inject biases explicitly. These nodes are initialized in a
zero-impact state and fine-tuned selectively to influence the model's behavior dynamically.
Theoretically formulated as:</p>
<p dir="auto">[ \text{For a given bias node } b_i: \left( \sum (0, \ldots, 0) \cdot w_i + b_i = 0 \right) ]</p>
<p dir="auto">This configuration ensures that initially, the model's output remains unchanged. The fine-tuning
phase employs Low-Rank Adaptation methodology to adjust the weights of these extra bias
nodes, enabling precise behavioral modifications within the system. The methodology introduces
a novel combination of input parameters enabling direct feedback and control of behavioral
responses, harnessing a decay function to modulate bias based on temporal factors and
simulating an AGI's 'experience' over time. The findings suggest that this mechanism not only
provides a pathway to more individualized AGI learning but also offers potential for continuous,
autonomous self-improvement, shifting the landscape of AGI capabilities.</p>
<p dir="auto">This approach promises to bridge the gap between static AGI models and the evolved requirement
for systems that present human-like adaptability, long-term learning capacity, and the ability to
respond to new and complex stimuli based on prior 'experiences'. The implications are vast, paving
the way for AGIs that can more accurately mimic human cognitive patterns and decision-making
processes.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) stands at the frontier of our quest to replicate and surpass the
cognitive capabilities of the human mind within computational systems. Current AGI models are
robust and capable, yet they fall short of the adaptable, experience-driven learning exhibited by
humans. The challenges these models face stem from static architectures unable to incorporate
multifaceted feedback or assimilate new knowledge without comprehensive retraining.</p>
<p dir="auto">The purpose of this research is to address these challenges by proposing a method that imbues
AGI systems with greater flexibility and adaptive learning capabilities. By integrating dynamic
bias injection layers, our approach enriches the AGI's potential to learn and evolve in response
to varied stimuli and interactions, akin to lived human experiences.</p>
<p dir="auto">This paper provides an overview of the bias injection layer method by extending the conventional
transformer model architecture to include additional input nodes that bear the capacity to alter
the behaviors of fine-tuning layers. Initializing these nodes to a neutral state, we achieve zero
impact on the model's existing functionality. Through selective fine-tuning of these nodes, we
induce nuanced behavioral changes. Such alterations simulate the AGI's ability to learn from
interactions over time, thereby paving the way for AGIs that can exhibit human-like adaptability
and cognitive growth.</p>

<li>Literature Review</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The evolution of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) architectures has been an ongoing endeavor,
marked by significant milestones yet also limited by discernible constraints. Existing AGI systems,
predominantly rooted in static, pre-trained neural network frameworks such as transformers, exhibit
impressive proficiency across various tasks. However, their adaptability is hampered due to an
inability to dynamically integrate new information or adjust to evolving contexts without extensive
retraining.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addressing these limitations, there has been a growing interest in fine-tuning techniques that
allow for model refinement without retraining the entirety of the network parameters. Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique where only a small subset of model
weights is adjusted, offering a path to incremental learning while preserving the bulk of pre-trained
knowledge. Other fine-tuning methods, including Prompt Tuning and Adapter Layers, have also
contributed to the field by enabling targeted modification of model behaviors.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, the integration of feedback loops into computational models stands as a testament to
our deeper understanding of dynamic systems theory and its applications in AI. By incorporating
mechanisms that allow for the internal states of the model to influence its future outputs, feedback
loops engender a degree of responsiveness and learning potential within AGI systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">The literature reflects a consistent pursuit of excellence in AGI architecture, with each approach
offering insights into possible avenues of innovation. This paper builds upon these insights,
proposing to enhance AGI systems via dynamic bias injection layers—a novel concept inspired by
the body of existing work, yet distinct in its potential to revolutionize AGI learning and adaptability.</p>

<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Conceptual Framework</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The theoretical framework for bias injection in neural networks is derived from the imperative to
overcome static limitations in AGI and instill a capacity for dynamic response that mimics human
cognitive flexibility. Traditional AI architectures operate with fixed parameters post-training,
lacking the ability to assimilate new information or adapt to changing environments without
undergoing a full retraining process—a computationally expensive and time-consuming endeavor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bias injection fundamentally reimagines this architecture by introducing supplementary inputs
that act as modulators for existing model parameters. The injected biases operate as dynamic
alterations that can pivot the model's responses, steering them towards specified outcomes
without requiring comprehensive retraining. The cornerstone of the concept is the ability for these
adjustments to occur in real-time, post-deployment, allowing the AGI to evolve its behaviors
based on ongoing interactions and feedback. This responsiveness is central to the pursuit of AGI
that operates not merely as a sophisticated program but rather as an entity capable of learning
from its environment in a manner analogous to biological organisms.</p>
<p dir="auto">Dynamic behavior in AGI is essential for embodiments of intelligence that endeavor to tackle
tasks of increasing complexity and variability. Unlike static models that can perform well within
the contours of their training data but falter outside of it, dynamic models promise a paradigm
where AGIs can cultivate knowledge continuously and apply it innovatively. The introduction
of extended input/output layers to facilitate bias injection responds to this necessity, reflecting
a progressive step towards AGIs that are genuinely adaptable and learning-centric, harmonizing
with the unpredictabilities of the real world.</p>
<ol start="4" dir="auto">
<li>Model Setup and Configuration</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">To facilitate dynamic adjustments within a pretrained transformer model while maintaining its
original state's integrity, we implement a zero-input initialization approach. This setup involves
the addition of new input nodes arranged to have no initial impact on the model's output. This
is achieved by setting the values of these nodes to zero and adjusting the associated weights
and biases such that the output, ((\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot input_i) + b_i), remains zero.</p>
<p dir="auto">The introduction of additional nodes requires careful calibration. Each node's weight is offset by
the corresponding bias such that the output is annulled when all additional inputs are zero,
following the relationship:</p>
<p dir="auto">[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = -b_i ]</p>
<p dir="auto">where ( w_i ) is the weight for the ( i^{th} ) additional input and ( b_i ) is the bias for the node.</p>
<p dir="auto">The model's original state is thus preserved with the new setup, but with extended capability for
bias injection, providing a foundation for post-training adaptability. The process of integrating
these nodes involves two critical stages: initial deployment and fine-tuning. During initial
deployment, we ensure that:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The extended input nodes mirror the model's existing structure to allow for cohesion and
integration.</li>
<li>The newly introduced adjustable weights are carefully tuned so that the biases can be modified
in subsequent training phases while maintaining the model's existing knowledge base.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This preparatory phase establishes the model's capability for later fine-tuning, where biases can
be applied incrementally, allowing the model to adjust its response patterns based on new data or
desired behaviors. The dual-objective here ensures that the AGI can learn and adapt without
compromising its pretrained abilities—signaling an evolution towards AGI that is both
knowledgeable and highly adaptive.</p>
<ol start="5" dir="auto">
<li>Methodology</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The experimental protocol adopted for introducing dynamic bias injection into the AGI's neural
network follows a methodical process designed to preserve the original model’s capabilities while
enabling adaptability through selective bias tuning.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 1: Initial Neutral Configuration</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Establish additional input and output nodes across the AGI's neural network layers.</li>
<li>Initialize the additional input nodes with zero values and adjust the weights and biases to
ensure that they bear no influence on the output in their initial form.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 2: Selective Backpropagation Setup</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Calibrate the backpropagation process to selectively apply only to the new additional nodes
and layers, preventing changes to the pre-existing weights and biases.</li>
<li>Design the learning rate and update rules to focus on the additional weights, ensuring
precision in their alteration and potential impact.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 3: Feedback and Learning</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Incorporate feedback loops into the AGI by allowing outputs during inference to signal
adjustments that impact subsequent responses.</li>
<li>Implement a time-decay function for the outputs to emulate behavioral changes correlated
with the lapse of interaction time, enhancing the model’s ‘experience’ with temporal dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 4: Layer-Specific Fine-Tuning</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Begin the fine-tuning phase by adjusting the weights of the additional nodes based on specific
interaction data, desired behaviors, and objectives, allowing the AGI to learn from new
scenarios without a full system retrain.</li>
<li>Monitor and adjust the fine-tuning approach based on the performance metrics and feedback
obtained, following a continuous learning paradigm for AGI improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 5: Adaptive Learning and Modification</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Introduce adaptive learning techniques that enable the AGI to self-tune based on its
interactions and simulated experiences, initiating ongoing behavioral refinement.</li>
<li>Continue to fine-tune the additional input nodes in iterative cycles, allowing the AGI to
adapt its behaviors in alignment with evolving objectives and feedback, simulating the
natural learning process seen in intelligent beings.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Throughout this process, a rigorous documentation protocol will accompany each stage to ensure
the reproducibility and transparency of the methodology. Additionally, ethical considerations
regarding AGI behavior adjustments will be observed to ensure alignment with responsible AI
practices.</p>
